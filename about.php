     UFF (United Fried Front) is an anarcha-queer interdisciplinary artist collective as well as a friend- and affinity group. We are a fluid collective with changing members, the amount of people organising our projects vary from two to eight people, depending on each member’s different capacities to engage. Our collective making process triggers a critical approach to the (both formal and informal) hierarchies of authorship. With some years of performing institutional critique and organic organising around local anti-gentrification activism in Rotterdam (NL) behind us, we now aim to stick together and find ways to support each other’s struggles across borders, as we find ourselves scattered over Europe, ultimately targeting the evergrowing fascist, imperialist and capitalist superstructures terrorizing everyone except our enemies. As a queer collective, we refuse to conform to labels and boxes of gender identities- because in violent times, the only identity we need is to fight back. We share resources to minimize our precarity as makers, which simultaneously increases our mobility. We need mobility- to stay in touch for real. It takes a village to build an artist, we cannot make revolutionary art alone.
